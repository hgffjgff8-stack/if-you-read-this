                        &emsp; You mean more to me than I can ever explain. You are the reason why I wake up every morning with a smile on my face. You are the source of my happiness and joy. You are the light of my world and the warmth of my heart. I want you to know how much I appreciate you and everything you do for me. You are always there to support me, encourage me, comfort me, and inspire me. You are always understanding, kind, and generous. You are always loyal, honest, and respectful. You are everything l ever dreamed of and more.
                    </span>

                    <span>
                        &emsp;  So, here it is… I like you, a lot. Maybe even love. Would you be my Valentine? No matter your answer, I just wanted you to know how special you are to me. You’ve filled my heart with warmth in ways I never expected, and for that, I’m grateful. But if you say yes, I promise to make every day feel like Valentine’s Day for you—to cherish you, to make you smile, and to remind you just how much you mean to me.
